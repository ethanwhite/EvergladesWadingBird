# Indicators

These indicators are used to judge the progress of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) (as well as non-CERP restoration projects) toward achieving restoration goals. Indicators are based on the maximum estimated counts of nesting pairs. These counts are coordinated across groups working in Loxahatchee NWR (aka WCA 1), Water Conservation Areas 2 and 3, and Everglades National Park.

### Max Counts
* year - 1980 indicates a pre-1980 rough estimate
* region - Loxahatchee NWR (aka WCA 1), Water Conservation areas 2 and 3, Everglades National Park, or total for all regions
* species - see [species table](../SiteandMethods/species_list.csv)
* count - Max estimate of nesting pairs

### Forager Ratio

The ratio of tactile/sight foraging species, calculated as (whib + wost)/greg.
